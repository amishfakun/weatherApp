## App Description
I am building a weather app as a personal side project to gain more experience using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The main learning goal for this is to gain familiarity with using APIs. I have completed this using a tutorial online since it is my first time using APIs.

The end product should look a little like this:

1) The user should be able to type a city name and get the weather.
2) The app will request permission to get user's location to provide weather in current location. If not possible, an error message will be displayed.


### Update 1
Built the main interface using a card interface, a search bar and a few basic weather details using HTML and CSS. So far this app is static (See gif) - Waiting on API key from Open weather to get validated. 

### Update 2
Using the API, the user can search specific cities and get the weather from it. In update 3, the app will ask for location.
